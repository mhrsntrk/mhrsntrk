## About
As a Senior Product Manager at The Hashgraph Association, I blend technical expertise with strategic vision, leveraging my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and MBA. My career in technology is driven by a passion for innovation and impactful leadership, with a particular focus on self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions.

Having worked extensively in the SSI field, I've developed deep knowledge and practical experience implementing decentralized identity systems. During my time at Energy Web, I led the development of Switchboard, one of the pioneering SSI systems in the industry, while also spearheading ecosystem products that integrated web3 technologies into the energy sector.

Now at The Hashgraph Association, I'm at the forefront of building a comprehensive self-sovereign identity system on Hedera. This role allows me to apply my knowledge of distributed ledger technology and my entrepreneurial background to push the boundaries of blockchain applications.

My work spans the intersection of blockchain, digital identity, and enterprise solutions, positioning me to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of decentralized technologies and their real-world implementations.
